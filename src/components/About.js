            I'm <span> Thejus </span>, a tech enthusiast pursuing my <span>MS in Software Engineering </span> from Boston, MA. Think of me as a code optimizer who gets excited about making systems run faster ‚Äì I actually managed to speed up processing times by 40% at IBM (yes, I'm that person who gets a kick out of performance metrics! üöÄ).
            <br/> <br/>
            When I'm not geeking out over cloud technologies, you'll find me building cool stuff like <span>CloudNotifyOps</span> ‚Äì (my latest project) or working on community platforms that help people connect and share resources like <span>locAll</span>. I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions, whether it's migrating legacy systems or creating real-time processing pipelines.
            My time at <span>IBM</span> taught me that great software is about more than just code ‚Äì it's about collaboration, continuous learning, and creating solutions that actually make a difference. I'm that developer who gets equally excited about optimizing database queries and mentoring team members! 
            Want to know more about me? Feel free to <a className='resume' href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hP9-vWW1ta2GNATZPwnoUivuZwuaYY5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore my resume.</a>

            Off the keyboard, I'm a huge sports fan! You'll catch me cheering for F1 races (talk about optimization in real life! üèéÔ∏è) or playing soccer, badminton, and cricket. Recently started exploring American sports too ‚Äì trying to wrap my head around baseball statistics and basketball plays. Nothing beats the thrill of both optimizing code and scoring goals! ‚öΩ
            <br/><br/>
            Looking to bring my mix of technical expertise and collaborative spirit to help build the next big thing. Let's create something awesome together! üåü
